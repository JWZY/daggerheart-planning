# Halden

**Ancestry:** Firbolg

## Short-term Goals
Halden would like to plot out a portion of land for the Town and his own personal homestead. He is looking for an area of property that could support small livestock, farming, a small home with room for additions, and enough area to continue to build outer buildings. The plot will be claimed by planting seeds from Anja's pear tree back home. Halden and company may need to clear out areas for housing for local residents from harmful pests/plants

Halden is also looking to prepare for infrastructure of Bonetop, and would like to secure a small, communal lumber yard. The Caravan may need to designate a cutting area, figure out transport logistics, and consider what type of wood is being harvested, potentially limited by the current tools at hand (2 story buildings may need stronger wood, which needs stronger tools to cut)

## Appearance
- Tall, blue skin and windswept grey hair, specks of auburn in it.
- Large, barrel chested build, clearly used to tilling fields and working with his strength
- Dressed practically, work clothes, and light armour from his youth
- understanding of death and that his time may come soon. People person, though can be focused on his personal goals

## Backstory
- Halden grew up with the Scarlett Scale, a monster hunter company, where he travelled far and wide protecting innocents and honing his skills as a slayer of beasts. He wanted nothing more.
- Until he came across a homestead under attack by a great Griffon. He slew the beast, but the woman who lived there did not praise him, instead scolding him for hurting the animal for following its instincts.
- Halden, too stubborn to leave without coming to an understanding, stayed at Anja's property; she too was stubborn and refused to let him live it down.
- Instead of returning to the Scarlett Scale, Halden began doing chores around the farm in an attempt to ease the tension, though Anja always found a way to show him how he was doing it wrong.
- Eventually, Halden moves into the abode, becoming a true and essential part in the farmhouse, and more importantly, to Anja.
- Halden and Anja fall in love, and they spend a fruitful, long life together. But all is not easy in the world of love.
- A fight, a final straw, and Halden storms off, hearing about a Wyvern attacking a nearby town. Anja cries but will not beg Halden to stay. Halden slays the beast, but as he looks at his bloodied sword, no praise from the townsfolk amounts to the love of Anja.
- He returns to Anja, and vows to never unsheathe his sword again, and so he does. Anja grows old, and Halden knows he will outlive her. As they make preparations for her departure from this realm, Halden makes a third and final vow to his love; that he will spread her ashes at the spot in which Nature and Beauty Reigns.
- Now leaving the homestead with Anja in his heart and sword hung at his side, Halden finds a poster for an expedition, with a quote from Anja's treasured book;
