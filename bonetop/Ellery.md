# Ellery

**Ancestry:** Clank

## Long Term Goal
**Graduate from the Academy** to prove to her maker that creating Ellery and teaching her magic was worthwhile

## Short Term Goal
**Find the perfect reading nook near Bonetop** for late-night study sessions, and to separate fact from fiction in fae riddles.

*"The residents of Bonetop must each be asked about good reading areas and a list of locations must be compiled. Then, Vinos and I will debate which area is best, and those in attendance (Halden, Finley, and Nellie) will vote to declare the ideal spot."*

## Appearance
- Wooden dummy with a very faint yellow glow lining each wooden groove.
- Always has her 'spell bracer' with her.
- Sometimes wears a blue cotton cowl over her shoulders (official colour of The Academy)
- Often found lost in thought, studying magic, or closely examining the structure of nearby buildings

**Visual Inspirations:** Posable Wooden Humanoid Models for artistic sketching, Modern-Day Crash Test Dummies, Slight hints of geometric shapes from Gundam or other mecha anime

## Backstory
- Ellery was once nothing more than one of many automated wooden spellcaster dummies used within the Research Wing of The Academy. Imbued with simple, low-level instructional magic, her only purpose was to cast a stabilizing spell. Within the stabilized space, real mages tested their limits casting very powerful, highly chaotic magic.
- One fateful day, a high-ranking mage was demonstrating his experiential research in a desperate attempt to maintain his position in The Academy. Ellery, tasked with stabilizing the spell, was struck in the head by the ricochet of a stray arc of magical energy. That moment is when she became sentient.
- Her haphazard creator, Alprazepam the Stern, improvised this result and began to use her as his thesis in magically sentient spellcasters.
- He enrolled Ellery as an apprentice at The Academy while documenting and showcasing her manufactured intellect to the wider Academy community.
- Ellery was happy to learn about magic and was determined to show appreciation to her maker by becoming the first animated graduate of the Academy.
- Seemingly, without warning, Alprazepam the Stern ordered Ellery to cease her studies. He instructed her to accompany Vinos, the academy mailboy, on an indefinite 'journey' outside of the Academy walls.
