## Long-term Goals He's Working Towards

## Backstory
- Youngest son of the goblin crime syndicate "The Flipped Coin"
- Oleg was weeks away from his rite of passage
- The image of the coin landing on heads was a wave of nausea. "Heads means 'their heads roll!'" his brothers would jeer. His mother would tap her nails expectantly.
- *This was stressing his aura*
- Oleg withdrew into his eccentricities.
- He discussed the matter extensively with the trees and spirits below.
- Only the East Wind answered:
- A crumpled flyer hit him in the face
- "A ground-breaking experience: Join the New World!"
- The next day he was packed, his prized possessions (all stolen) crammed in a satchel: *Compendium of Fae Spirits*, *The Energy of Nature*, A black ring, and a box of shiny objects
- The large scarf hugged him. His gloves thrummed with energy.
- His boots sang as he approached the caravan.
