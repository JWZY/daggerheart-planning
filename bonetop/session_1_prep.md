# Session 1: "The Arrival"

*See `DM Notes` for full Goal & Faction breakdown.*

## Scene 1: The Overlook (Introduction)
*   **Setting the Scene:**
    *   The wagon crests the final hill as the sun begins to set.
    *   **Visual:** In the distance, the colossal **Dragon Skeleton** (Bonetop) rises from the earth, its ribs forming natural white arches against the sky. The lake ("Mirrorwater") reflects the orange light.
    *   **Atmosphere:** Quiet, ancient, and slightly ominous but beautiful.
*   **Player Choice:**
    *   Where do they park the wagon?
    *   *Halden* assesses the soil quality.
    *   *Ellery* checks the magical ley lines coming off the bones.
    *   *Oleg* sniffs the air for the "East Wind" or other spirits.

## Scene 2: Making Camp (Skill Challenge)
*   **The Goal:** Establish a safe perimeter and shelter before nightfall (or the storm rolls in).
*   **The Obstacle:** The land is wild and resists being tamed.
*   **Mechanics:** Group Skill Challenge (Need 3 Successes before 3 Failures).
    *   **Halden:** Clearing brush, moving heavy stones (Strength/Blade).
    *   **Ellery:** Casting *Prestidigitation* to clean, or warding the area (Knowledge/Spellcast).
    *   **Oleg:** Setting tripwires or talking to the local pests to leave (Finesse/Instinct).
*   **Fey Shenanigan (Optional):** If they fail a check, a **Bone-Tender** (small crab-like fey) steals a hammer or tent peg, forcing a chase.

## Scene 3: The Scavengers (Combat)
*   **Trigger:** As the camp is being set (or just as they finish), they disturb the current residents.
*   **Enemies:**
    *   **3x Hollow-Hounds:** Skeletal coyotes that feed on the dragon's calcium.
    *   *OR*
    *   **1x Rot-Badger:** A magically mutated badger that is *very* territorial.
*   **Stakes:** They aren't trying to kill the party, just drive them off or steal food.
*   **Victory:** Driving them off or calming them down (Oleg might try to befriend them).

## Scene 4: The First Night (Downtime/Bonding)
*   **Atmosphere:** The fire is crackling. The stars are out through the dragon's ribs.
*   **Campfire Prompts:**
    *   "What is one comfort item your character brought that they probably shouldn't have?"
    *   "Who takes the first watch?"
    *   "What is for dinner?" (Cooking check?)
*   **NPC Moments:**
    *   **Finley:** Is loudly complaining about the lack of a feather bed. Needs someone to help him set up his "luxury" tent.
    *   **Nellie:** Offers a salve for any scratches from the fight. Asks about everyone's medical history.
    *   **Vinos:** Is just chilling, maybe playing a small instrument.

## Scene 5: The Next Morning (The Cliffhanger)
*   The sun rises, hitting the Dragon Skull.
*   **Halden's Moment:** Planting the Pear Seed.
*   **The Hook:** As the seed goes into the earth, the ground vibrates.
    *   *Option A:* The **East Wind** whispers to Oleg: "It wakes..."
    *   *Option B:* A mysterious figure is seen watching from atop the Dragon's skull, then vanishes.
